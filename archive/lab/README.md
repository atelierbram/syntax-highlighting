## Code Syntax Highlighter Builder      
Edit the sixteen color-value variables, and create your own syntax highlighter colorscheme.   

When using Base16 Builder as a building tool, you can, like Solarized, make colorschemes that come in a light, - and in a dark background version.      
  The class-names that are used here in this 'Colorscheme Lab', are basically the same as in the template.erb files by Base16 Builder, so after creating a colorscheme with this lab, converting to many application formats for syntax highlighting comes within reach.    
  Base16 Builder requires Ruby 1.9 or greater, [see the repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) for more information.
