Changelog for Atelier Schemes
-----------------------------

Besides documenting my learning curve, another reason for these explanations is to give insight in the changes to third parties, who are already using these colorschemes.

### Changes — March, 2015
Nothing is ever perfect, and the act of creation is an iterative process. But there is also a fine line between improving something, and “falsification of ones growth process”. Trying to avoid the latter, this is one of the reasons for documenting the changes I made in syntax-highlighting colorschemes, I started to make now almost two years ago ….

### [Forest](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/forest/)
#### Changes — March, 2015
Three changes for Forest, since March 14, 2015, _see also [the html version of this ChangeLog](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/changelog/)_: it’s all about readability, avoiding color-clashes, and balance.

1. Changed value for green: base0B changed from `#5ab738` to `#7b9726` (much warmer green, now it doesn’t clash with the red anymore).
2. Changed value for cyan (more towards blue): base0B changed from `#00ad9c` to `#3d97b8`
3. Changed value for yellow (slightly darker): base0A changed from `#d5911a` to `#c38418`

#### Why changing?
Because ones the defect is seen, it can’t be unseen …

In my eyes, after some time I started to get distracted by the clash between the red and the green. Thinking the green was drawing unnessesary attention to itself. It really comes to the front, because of the warm brownish background in this scheme as well, but not in a way that is in harmony with the rest of the colors of the colorscheme. In the end it’s all about balance.

So by changing the hue value of green more towards the yellow, making it “warmer”, in a sense, this clash is gone, the text becomes more readable, for it doesn't draw the wrong attention to itself.

Before the yellow looked just a bit too faded on a light background. Making yellow a tiny bit darker gave it more presence among the other colors on a light background, while still holding it’s own on a dark background …

Now because green was given a warmer value, cyan had to be changed as well, to keep logical intervals between the colors. More [information](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/forest/) on code, color-values and more ….

### [Heath](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/heath)
#### Changes — March, 2015
One changed value for green: base0B changed from `#379a37` to `#918b3b` (a radical change, a much warmer green).

Here it was really the clash between the green and the background that began to bother me after a while. The green pops out from the warm brownish background, cathing the eye more than the other colors. So again, by changing the hue value of green more towards the yellow, making it “warmer”, it fits in more harmoniously within the colorscheme.

### [Sulphurpool](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/sulphurpool)
Sulphurpool is a the most recent colorscheme, the changes documented in the Changelog are not likely to affect any implementation.

### [Lakeside](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/lakeside)
#### Changes — March, 2015

One changed value for violet: base0E changed from `#5d5db1` to `#6b6bb8` (a slightly lighter violet). The lightened purple, _here called ‘violet’_ performs much better on the dark background.

### [Seaside](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/seaside)
#### Changes — March, 2015
1.  Changed value for yellow (quit a bit darker): base0A changed from `#c3c322` to `#98981b`
2.  Changed value for lightest color (less saturated): base07 changed from `#f0fff0` to `#f4fbf4`

After a while the intense saturation of the lightest green, here as background-color, started to be a distraction for me, and the yellow looked far too light on this light background. Desaturating the lightest color `base07` makes this background-color on light-themes much quiter. Making yellow quite a bit darker gave it more presence among the other colors on a light background, while still holding it’s own on a dark background …

### [Dune](https://atelierbram.github.io/syntax-highlighting/atelier-schemes/dune)
#### Changes — March, 2015

Changed value for yellow (slightly darker): base0A changed from `#cfb017` to `#ae9513`

Yellow looked too light on this light background. Making yellow quite a bit darker gave it more presence among the other colors on a light background, while still holding it’s own on a dark background …
